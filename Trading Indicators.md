## Trading Indicators

Trading indicators are mathematical calculations applied to the price and volume data of a financial instrument, such as a stock, currency pair, or commodity, to provide insights into the market's trend, momentum, volatility, and other relevant factors.

These indicators assist traders and investors in making informed decisions about buying or selling an asset, determining the entry and exit points of a trade, and managing risk. 

Some common examples of trading indicators listed below.

- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
    - This indicator has 4 components
        - MACD Line
            - 12 day moving average
        - Signal Line
            - 26 day moving average
        - Histogram
        - Zero Line
    - It alone only works in `uptrend`, during down trend it gives false signal. Combined with other indicators it can give good performance. For example.
        - Combined with 200 days moving average or EMA (exponential moving average) it can clarifiy trading entry position
        - But (MACD + EMA) combination works poorly in case of sideways clearly calculating with support and resistence can work

- Percentage Price Oscillator
    - The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is a technical analysis indicator that is used to measure the difference between two moving averages as a percentage. It is similar to the `Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)` indicator, but instead of showing the difference between two moving averages as an absolute value, it shows it as a percentage.
    - `PPO = (Fast Moving Average - Slow Moving Average) / Slow Moving Average * 100`
    - The PPO is typically shown as a histogram, with positive values indicating that the fast moving average is above the slow moving average and negative values indicating that it is below.
    - Traders may use the PPO to identify trends and potential trade setups. A rising PPO indicates that the fast moving average is rising faster than the slow moving average, which can be a bullish sign. 
    - Conversely, a falling PPO indicates that the fast moving average is falling faster than the slow moving average, which can be a bearish sign. The PPO can also be used to identify divergences, which may indicate a potential trend reversal.
    - It is important to note that the PPO is just one of many technical analysis indicators and should not be used in isolation. 
    - It is important to consider other factors, such as price and volume, when making trading decisions
