> Frequently Encountered Trading Term Definitions

`Trading` refers to the practice of buying and selling financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and other assets with the goal of making a profit.

`Day trading` involves buying and selling assets within a single trading day, and often involves taking advantage of short-term price movements. 

`Swing trading` on the other hand, involves holding positions for a few days or weeks, and involves taking advantage of short-term trends in the market.

`Position trading` also known as long-term trading, involves holding assets for a longer period of time, often several months or years. 

`Spot trading` refers to the buying and selling of securities or other assets for immediate settlement. This means that when you engage in spot trading, the transaction is completed and the assets are delivered to the buyer or seller on the same day, or on the next business day if the trade is conducted after market hours. For example, if you buy 100 shares of a company's stock through spot trading, you will receive those 100 shares in your account on the same day or the next business day, depending on the time of the trade.

`Margin trading` involves the use of borrowed funds from a broker to trade securities or other assets. This allows traders to potentially increase their buying power and make larger trades than they would be able to with just their own funds. However, margin trading also carries a higher level of risk, as traders are responsible for any losses incurred on the borrowed funds. For example, if you have $10,000 in your account and your broker allows you to trade on margin with a 2:1 ratio, you could trade up to $20,000 worth of securities. However, if the value of those securities declines, you could lose more than your initial investment.

`Futures trading` involves the buying and selling of contracts for the future delivery of a particular asset. These contracts are standardized in terms of quantity, quality, and expiration date, and they are traded on futures exchanges. For example, if you believe the price of oil will rise in the future, you could buy a futures contract for the delivery of a certain amount of oil at a future date. If the price of oil does indeed rise, you could sell the contract for a profit.

`Option trading` is the practice of buying and selling options contracts. An option is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.  

This means that if the price of the underlying asset moves in a way that is not favorable to you, you can choose not to exercise your option and simply let it expire. In this case, your potential loss is limited to the premium you paid for the option.

One potential risk of option trading is time decay. This refers to the fact that the value of an option tends to decrease as the expiration date approaches, assuming the underlying stock price remains the same. This means that even if an option is initially in the money (meaning it has intrinsic value), it could expire out of the money if the underlying stock price doesn't move as expected.

Another potential risk of option trading is the possibility of losing more than your initial investment. This can happen if you buy an option that is out of the money (meaning it has no intrinsic value) and the underlying stock price doesn't move as expected. In this case, the option will expire with no value and you will lose the premium you paid for it.

There are two types of options: call options and put options. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a certain price, known as the strike price, on or before the expiration date of the option. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a certain price on or before the expiration date.

Options can be traded on various financial markets, including exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Options can also be traded as part of a broader strategy, such as a covered call or a straddle.

`Arbitrage` is the practice of buying and selling assets, such as stocks or currencies, in different markets or in different forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset. This allows an investor to profit from the difference in price by buying an asset in one market where it is undervalued and selling it in another market where it is overvalued. Arbitrage can be a risky strategy, as it involves buying and selling assets very quickly in order to take advantage of small price differences. However, it can also be a very profitable way to invest if it is done carefully and with a solid understanding of the markets.

`Matching Engine` A stock market's core matching engine is the central component of a stock exchange's trading platform. It is responsible for matching buy and sell orders for stocks and other securities. The matching engine uses complex algorithms to ensure that trades are executed quickly and efficiently.

The matching engine works by constantly monitoring the orders that are submitted to the exchange by traders. When a buy or sell order is submitted, the matching engine will search for any matching orders that have already been submitted. If a match is found, the matching engine will execute the trade and update the relevant accounts accordingly.

The matching engine is typically a highly sophisticated and complex piece of software, as it must be able to handle a large number of orders and execute trades quickly and accurately. It is designed to be able to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and must be able to handle a high volume of traffic without any downtime.

In addition to matching orders, the matching engine may also be responsible for other functions, such as enforcing rules and regulations, monitoring for fraudulent activity, and providing real-time data and analytics to traders and other stakeholders.

Overall, the core matching engine is a critical component of a stock exchange's trading platform, and plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient and fair operation of the stock market.

There are many different stock exchange matching engines in use today, and which one is considered the best may vary depending on who you ask. Some of the most popular and well-known matching engines include the NYSE's MatchPoint, the NASDAQ's OMX trading platform, and the London Stock Exchange's Millennium Exchange. These platforms are known for their high speeds, reliability, and ability to handle large volumes of trades.

`What is derivative exchange?`

A derivative exchange is a marketplace where derivatives are traded. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such as a commodity, currency, or index. Derivatives are used to manage risk or speculate on the future price movements of the underlying asset.

Derivative exchanges offer a variety of derivative products, including futures, options, and swaps. These products can be traded by market participants, including individual investors, hedge funds, and financial institutions. Derivative exchanges are regulated by government agencies and are typically operated by exchange companies.

Derivative exchanges can be physical or electronic. Physical derivative exchanges, also known as open outcry exchanges, involve traders and brokers physically buying and selling derivatives on a trading floor. Electronic derivative exchanges, on the other hand, allow traders to buy and sell derivatives through an electronic platform.

Derivative exchanges play a key role in the financial markets by providing a central location for the buying and selling of derivatives and by setting the terms and conditions for trading these products. They also help to reduce the risk of default by requiring that traders post collateral, or margin, to cover potential losses.

`What is DROP COPY in exchange`
Drop copy is a term used in the context of financial exchanges to refer to the electronic transmission of trade information from one exchange to another. This information typically includes details such as the price, quantity, and time of the trade. Drop copy is used by exchanges to ensure that all relevant parties have access to accurate and up-to-date information about trades that have been executed on the exchange. It is also used as a mechanism for clearing and settling trades, as well as for regulatory reporting purposes.


`What is MTA, GEM market?`
MTA (Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan-Only, formerly known as the Mortgage-Backed Securities Index) and GEM (Global Equity Market) are financial indices that are used to track the performance of certain types of securities.

MTA is a market index that tracks the performance of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), also known as Ginnie Mae. These securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have been guaranteed by the U.S. government.

GEM is a market index that tracks the performance of publicly traded companies that are listed on major global exchanges. It is designed to provide a broad measure of the performance of the global equity market.

Both the MTA and GEM indices are used by financial professionals and market analysts to assess the performance of certain segments of the financial markets. They are also used as benchmarks for investment products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

`OTC market` The over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market where securities are bought and sold directly between parties, rather than through a central exchange. It is also known as the "off-exchange" market.

In contrast to exchange-traded securities, which are traded on organized exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ, OTC securities are traded directly between buyers and sellers through a network of dealers or market makers. These dealers act as intermediaries, facilitating the trade and providing liquidity to the market.

The OTC market is generally less regulated and more opaque than the exchange-traded market, as there is no central clearinghouse or exchange to provide transparency and ensure the fair and orderly settlement of trades. As a result, the OTC market is generally considered to be more risky than the exchange-traded market.

OTC securities include a wide range of financial instruments, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, and currencies. They are often issued by smaller, less well-known companies that do not meet the listing requirements of organized exchanges, or by companies that wish to avoid the costs and regulatory requirements of listing on an exchange. Examples of OTC securities include penny stocks, bonds issued by small or emerging companies, and customized derivatives.

`CAGR` stands for Compound Annual Growth Rate. It is a financial metric that measures the rate of return for an investment over a period of time, typically several years. CAGR is calculated by taking the nth root of the total return of an investment, where n is the number of years in the investment period. The CAGR represents the "smoothed out" annual return of an investment, which can be useful for comparing the performance of different investments. It helps to understand the growth rate of an investment over time.

Let's say you invested $10,000 in a stock 5 years ago, and today the value of your investment is $15,000. To calculate the CAGR:

Determine the total return of the investment by subtracting the initial investment from the current value of the investment: $15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000.
Divide the total return by the initial investment: $5,000 / $10,000 = 0.5.
Add 1 to the result: 0.5 + 1 = 1.5.
Raise the result to the power of (1/5) to calculate the CAGR: 1.5^(1/5) = 1.096 or 9.6%.
So in this example, the CAGR for the investment over the past 5 years is 9.6%. This means that the investment has grown at an average annual rate of 9.6% per year over the past 5 years.

`P/E ratio:` The Price to Earnings ratio, which is a valuation ratio calculated as the company's current stock price divided by its earnings per share (EPS). A high P/E ratio suggests that investors are paying more for each unit of earnings.

`EPS:` The Earnings per Share, which represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. In this case, the EPS is reported as 0, which may indicate that the company is not profitable.

`Price/ NAV:` The Price to Net Asset Value ratio, which is a measure of how much a company's stock is trading for compared to its net asset value. A value of 0.73 suggests that the stock is trading at a discount to its net asset value.

`Free Float:` The Free Float represents the portion of a company's shares that are readily available for trading and not held by major shareholders or insiders. A free float of 57.53% suggests that a significant portion of the shares are available for trading.

`Beta:` A measure of a stock's volatility compared to the market. A beta of 1.27 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the market average, which is represented by a beta of 1.

`BLOCK Market` is the market for bulk selling and buying on automatic matching with equal quantity and best price (all or none condition) basis. Orders entered in this market are immediately flashed on all trading workstations. The minimum amount for a bid of bulk lot for a certain security shall be Tk. 5 Lac at market price unless otherwise fixed by the Council from time to time with the approval of the SEC.

`Mortgaze` bank loan with down payment with house as collateral. It connects home owners to institutional investors. Any credit card or loan is a way to generate profit. Home owners buy from broker who connects to mortgaze lenders who in turn works for investment banker. Investment banker buys uses leverage to buy lots og mortgazes to amplify output. Often no risk, down payment, proof of income which are `sub prime mortgazes`.

`Collaterized Debt Obligation` collection of mortgazes. Packed in different stages- safe, medium, risky. The safe AAA rated bucket is hedged or ensured with `Credit default swap`. Risky slice goes to hedge funds. 

`Short Selling` comes with 200% reward and infinite loss. It is leveraged trading. Short squeeze happens during shorting.

`Credit Default Swap` is a financial derivative contract between two parties, where one party agrees to pay the other party in the event of a credit event, such as default, bankruptcy or a failure to pay by a third party.

The CDS contract works by the buyer of the contract paying a periodic premium to the seller, in exchange for a promise to be compensated in the event of a credit event. The amount of compensation is typically based on the difference between the face value of the bond and its market value after the credit event.

CDS contracts are commonly used by investors to manage credit risk in their portfolios. For example, if an investor holds a bond, they may purchase a CDS contract to hedge against the possibility of the issuer defaulting. Similarly, investors who do not hold the bond may also buy CDS contracts to speculate on the possibility of a credit event occurring.
